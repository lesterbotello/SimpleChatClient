# ChatClient
Sample chat client using ASP.NET MVC and [SignalR](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR "SignalR").

### Background
This sample application is part of an ASP.NET MVC class I taught way back in 2017. It was built in-class to illustrate using the use of sockets in a web application. The app is in its original form, so used technologies might need to be updated to more recent versions.

### Usage
Load the project using the most recent version of Visual Studio and launch the app. When prompted for a user name, enter it. Then open a separate browser window/tab pointing to the same address and enter a different user name. You should be able to exchange messages between the two browser windows. You can add infinite clients to the chat session and exchange messages between all of them in real time.
